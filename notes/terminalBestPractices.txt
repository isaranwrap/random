(0) Open 3 terminal windows;

(1) 
Window 1: Sparse (Parsimonious/Terse/Succint) 
Window 2: Two tabs (2.1 and 2.2 or alternatively, 2 and 4)
	2.1: Work Zone 1
	2.2: Work Zone 2 

(2) Start at Terminal 3. Work is done in primarily 4 & 2 and commands are entered in 1.

(3) 



Reasoning:


Many principles are at play here. 

For one, having multiple work stations can be quite beneficial towards partitioning work. When the requisite work is done; less important work can get done.
This system lends itself naturally towards prioritized work and works with concepts like stacks and queues. 

Window 2 switching between tabs -
- macOS: CTRL + SHIFT + TAB
- Linux: CTRL + SHIFT + TAB
- Windows: zzZ 

It's best to try to keep the work zone to 1 or 2 tasks (MAX!!) We work much better on a single task at a time. 

The commands from terminal are the best reflections of the mind; 
ex: clear;
